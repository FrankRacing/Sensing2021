# Olin Baja Electrical 2021


This repository contains the hardware, firmware, software, and important technical documents for the 2021 iteration of Olin College of Engineering's Baja project team.

## Repository structure

- hardware: boards 
- packages: store
- parts: COTs 


## Instructions to commit:

The main branch is protected, so you cannot commit directly! You need to make a branch first. We suggest learning how to use VSCode's Version Control tab and installing the GitLens extension.

- Make sure your main branch is up to date (git pull)
- Make sure you're on the main branch
- Call `git checkout -b <your initials>/<branch_name>` 
  - IE for me it would be `git checkout -b jk/important_feature`
- Work on your code, committing frequently
- Push your code to Github
- Make a pull request with your branch
- Wait for your code to be reviewed, responding to review requests
- Merge your branch, and then delete it.

This process will need to be repeated for every change you want to make to the main repository
